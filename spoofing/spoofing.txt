Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages. It allows unauthorized access to user data and can compromise user interactions with the site. To prevent XSS, secure practices include escaping user input (turning special characters into non-executable text), validating input to ensure it meets expected formats, and implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict where scripts can run from. These measures prevent the execution of malicious scripts, safeguarding user data and interactions.
