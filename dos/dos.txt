- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
    SQL Injection, a vulnerability exploited by injecting malicious SQL code, is prevented in secure versions by implementing techniques like parameterized queries, which separate user input from SQL commands, and input validation to neutralize harmful characters, ensuring that input is treated as data, not executable code.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

To bolster defense against SQL injection, deploy ORM libraries, enforce least privilege, use web application firewalls, conduct regular security audits, employ input/output encoding, enforce CSP, and deploy database firewalls.
